When detecting a case infected with Coronavirus, among the most important challenges facing the medical staff is 
to know the people who have contact with the infected person 
and  the virus was probably spread to them

--------------------------
Our solution is to develop a mobile application that enables you to know if you have visited a place at the same time that an infected person visited it, and the virus was probably spread to you
Which will contribute to the detection of infected cases quickly
